 A game of Connect Four takes place over a number of turns, as two players battle it out to connect four pieces in a line!
Each turn, you are allowed drop a piece in an available column. Players alternate in turns until either one player makes 
four pieces in a line, or the whole board fills up. The pieces can form a consecutive four in any row, column, or diagonal in order to win.

The game is played on a board of an entered width and height â€” the classic Connect Four board is 7 columns wide by 6 rows tall.
